## Introduction
This repository contains the neccesary code for running Rebound.
You can also take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/jwparsons/Rebound) and [matchmaking server](https://github.com/jwparsons/Rebound_MatchmakingServer).


## Requirements
Running the client/server executables requires Windows and running the matchmaking server requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).


## Contribution
This project was created by me and Tyler Kelly for the class Concurrent, Parallel, & Distributed Programming at FSU.
I was responsible for game design, artwork, mechanics, multiplayer support, and the matchmaking system.

Enjoy!
